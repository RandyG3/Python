# Declare a sum_difference function that accepts two lists of numbers.
# It should return the difference between the sum of values in the first and the second one
#
# sum_difference([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]) => 6 - 7 => -1
# sum_difference([4, 5], [2, 3, 6])    => 9 - 11 => -2
# sum_difference([1], [])              => 1
